    <p class="author">BY PHILIP LARKIN</p>
    <p>They fuck you up, your mum and dad.<br> 
    They may not mean to, but they do.<br>   
    They fill you with the faults they had<br>
    And add some extra, just for you.</p>
    <p>But they were fucked up in their turn<br>
    By fools in old-style hats and coats,<br>   
    Who half the time were soppy-stern<br>
    And half at one another’s throats.</p>
    <p>Man hands on misery to man.<br>
    It deepens like a coastal shelf.<br>
    Get out as early as you can,<br>
    And don’t have any kids yourself.</p>
